What is Node.JS?

--> Node.JS is cross platform, open source javascript runtime environment that can run on windows, linux, unix, MacOS and more. Nodejs runs chrome's V8 engine and executes javascript code outside a web browser.

--> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

-->It is maintained by the OpenJS Foundation.

-->Node.js allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser
*****This means that while JavaScript is traditionally associated with the web and
browsers, Node.js extends its reach, allowing you to run JavaScript code on
servers, desktops, and even embedded systems. This is why Node.js is often
described with the phrase "Run JavaScript Everywhere.*****

--> Node.js features an event-driven architecture and supports asynchronous
I/O (non-blocking I/O).

History 

--> NodeJS was built by Ryan Dahl in 2009

--> To run the JS, you always need an JS engine.

--> Everywhere you write JS code, there is an JS engine, that executes the code.

--> Ryan started with the Spider-Monkey Js Engine, which is found on Firefox.
but in two days he tried using v8 and never looked back.

--> earlier, Ryan was working independently, but there was a company named
Joyent, and this company was working on something similar to NodeJS. and
they hire Ryan to work under us, we will fund your project. big contribution to
Joyent Company.

--> The earlier name of Node.js was Web.js, but Ryan Dahl later renamed it to
Node.js because it was intended to be used for more than just web servers.
Apache HTTP Server was a blocking server, so Ryan wanted to create a nonblocking server, which is why Node.js is a non-blocking I/O.The advantage of
a non-blocking server is that it can handle multiple requests with a smaller
number of threads.
In 2010, NPM (Node Package Manager) was introduced. NPM is a package
manager for Node.js, and it played a critical role in the success of Node.js.
