1 . Basic HTTP Server and Routing
Create a simple HTTP server using Node's http module that responds to the following routes:
GET / - Respond with "Welcome to the Node.js HTTP Server!"
GET /about - Respond with "This is the about page."
POST /submit - Accept form data and respond with "Data received!"


2. File System Operations (fs)
Using Node's fs module:
Create a new file called notes.txt and write some text content into it.
Read and display the content of notes.txt in the console.
Append new content to notes.txt, then read and log the updated content.
Delete notes.txt after verifying it exists.

3. Basic CRUD with Express and JSON Storage
Build a simple Express server that manages a collection of items (e.g., a list of books). Store the data in a JSON file and implement CRUD operations:
GET /books - Retrieve and display all books.
POST /books - Add a new book to the collection.
PUT /books/:id - Update details of a specific book by its ID.
DELETE /books/:id - Remove a specific book from the collection.

4. Routing and Middleware in Express
Set up a mini Express app with the following routes:
GET / - Display a welcome message.
GET /products - Respond with a JSON array of products.
POST /products - Accept product data and add it to your array.
Create a custom middleware that logs the route accessed and the timestamp.
Add error handling middleware to catch any unexpected issues and respond with a 500 status code and a friendly message.
